            <p>The movie begins shortly after the events of "Avengers: Infinity War," where the villain Thanos has
                wiped out half of all life in the universe using the Infinity Stones. <br> <br>
                They learn that the Infinity Stones could possibly be used to undo Thanos' actions.
                Tony Stark and Nebula are rescued from space by Captain Marvel, and the Avengers devise a plan to
                travel through time using the Quantum Realm to retrieve the Infinity Stones from various points in
                the past. <br><br>
                The Avengers split into teams to collect the Stones. They face several challenges and encounters
                with their past selves and adversaries.
                Ultimately, they gather all the Stones, but a past version of Thanos learns of their plan and
                travels to the present, intent on destroying the universe and rebuilding it in his own image.
                <br><br>
                In a climactic battle, all the heroes unite to confront Thanos and his army. Iron Man sacrifices
                himself by using the Infinity Stones to disintegrate Thanos and his forces, but at the cost of his
                own life.
                With Thanos defeated and the Stones destroyed, the surviving Avengers mourn the loss of their friend
                and colleague.
                The film ends with a funeral for Tony Stark, as the remaining heroes reflect on his sacrifice and
                the new world they must navigate without him.
                Captain America returns the Stones to their original timelines but chooses to remain in the past to
                live a life with Peggy Carter.
                He passes on his shield to Falcon (Sam Wilson), who assumes the mantle of Captain America, while
                Thor appoints Valkyrie as the new ruler of Asgard. <br><br>
                "Avengers: Endgame" concludes with a sense of closure for many characters while also setting the
                stage for the next phase of the Marvel Cinematic Universe.
